# Lilipad_2.0

If you don't have npm installed install npm for your distribution. After that, run in the project's root folder: 
```bash
npm install vue vue-material
```


Bear in mind it's still in development mode, you must run first (in your console):
```bash
make vuedev
```

This will run the frontend over the 8080 port, then you must run (in another console):
```bash
python run.py
```

After that, you open your browser and type: "localhost:8080" and that's it!!!
